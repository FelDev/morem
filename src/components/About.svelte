    <p>The goal of Morem is to help you gradually increase your daily/weekly/whateverly meditation time.</p>
    <p>To do so, Morem let's you select the time for your current meditation as a starting point. Then, you can select the amount of time you would like to add daily/weekly/whateverly.</p>
    <p>You can save this to your phone, like an app. Find a button that says "Add to home screen". (The location of this button depends on your browser.).</p>
    <p>This is completely free to use.</p>
    <!-- <p>Your feedback is welcome.</p> -->
